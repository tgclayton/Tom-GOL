## About
This app was created after I finished boot camp. Early on in boot camp we were tasked with creating a simple implementation of the Game of Life, and I enjoyed the challenge so much that I decided to expand and improve on it in my own time. This is my current passion project, constantly tinkering with it and trying to find new ways to make it more efficient. The current live version is in a somewhat broken state. I am in the process of building a new version from scratch that is better organised and presented.
